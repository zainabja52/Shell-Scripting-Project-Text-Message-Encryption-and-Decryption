# Shell-Scripting-Project-Text-Message-Encryption-and-Decryption
This shell script implements a basic encryption and decryption algorithm for text messages containing only alphabet characters. The encryption/decryption method relies on XOR (exclusive OR) logic, allowing users to transform messages in a simple and reversible manner.
